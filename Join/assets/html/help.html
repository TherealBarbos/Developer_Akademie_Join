        <div class="textBig">What is Join?</div>
        <div class="textNormal">
          <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
          group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp
          at the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning
          "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
          work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages
          the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
          in an intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that <span>Join</span>
          is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
          extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible
          user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
          reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span>Join</span>.

              <p>Exploring the Board</p>
              When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
              represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
              "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
            </div>

              <p>Creating Contacts</p>
              In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
              to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
              required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
              tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

              <p>Adding Cards</p>
              Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
              the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

              <p>Moving Cards</p>
              As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
              on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
              another.

            <div class="textNormal">
              <p>Deleting Cards</p>
              Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
              list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
              the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
              action is irreversible. Remember that using <span>Join</span> effectively
              requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the
              board reflects the current state of your project. Have more
              questions about <span>Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at [Your Contact
